  print result

4. HCF/ GCD
   Get the num and check condition num equal to 1 perform HCF else GCD
   if num equal to 1 means First get 2 num and make a while loop and check
   the condition not equal to zero modulo two number store in res assign
   num1 equal to num2 and num2 equal to rem and print the num2 as result
   if num not equal to 1 means First get 2 num and call the function as gcd
   check num2==0 return num1 otherwise call the function untill num2 equal to 0.
   return and print the result.
  
  
 5. Convert Binary to Decimal/Octal/Hexa
    First get a number and get another number for choosing the conversion. check 
    choice equal to 1 convert to decimal  choice equal to 2 convert to Octal
